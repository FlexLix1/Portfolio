# Game Programmer & Designer
My name is Furkan Cirik. I’m a passionate & driven programmer and designer with over half of a decade of experience in game design and programming. What makes me passionate about games is the chance to show my combination of creativity and technology, together to create an interactive experience that pulls the player in. Whether it’s scripting or designing the next enemy, I aim to tell a story that catches the attention of the utmost elite.

For this project, I was working as the project leader and as a programmer. I worked mainly on the movement and helped with some of the puzzles in the game design. It was a difficult task but it taught me a lot about leadership and how to work as a team i.e. How to help to elevate those in the team with their strength and help with their weaknesses. 

### About the game

You play as Julius Time, the apprentice of Master Uhu, who is a watchmaker. Your goal in this game is to solve puzzles, reach the top of the clocktower to repair the clock at the top and save those townfolks.

### Introduction

My main focus for this project was to able to plan the project as clearly for my teammates as possible and make it as adaptable too. Meaning that, if any sudden changes were needed in the project, they'd be implemented immediately without causing a hassle for the team, or worse, stop the project from moving forward. Even so, without proper experience, it proved to be a difficult task. During the start of the project, I took the time to make it as simple for the team to communicate to each other with the use of Discord in the style of Slack where we had different channels dedicated to each part of the game i.e. game design, sound design etc.
